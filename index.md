## Former Projects

- [**Safe Learning Control**][el] ([website](https://www.dynsyslab.org/safe-robot-learning/)). As data- and learning-based methods gain traction, researchers must also understand how to leverage them in real-world robotic systems, where implementing and guaranteeing safety is imperative—to avoid costly hardware failures and allow deployment in the proximity of human operators. The last half-decade has seen a steep rise in the number of contributions to this area from both the control and reinforcement learning communities. To demystify and unify the language and frameworks used in control theory and reinforcement learning research—as well as to facilitate fair comparisons between these fields—we propose a set of physics-based benchmarks with intuitive APIs to support the implementation of safe and robust learning control.

- Mitacs Elevate postdoctoral fellowship: [**Multi-agent reinforcement learning for decentralized UAV/UGV cooperative exploration**][el]. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence has flourished. From a research niche, it has been developed into a versatile tool, seemingly on route to bring automation into every aspect of human life. At the same time, robotics technology has also advanced significantly, and inexpensive multi-robot systems promise to accomplish all those tasks that require both physical parallelism and inherent fault tolerance—such as surveillance and extreme-environment exploration. GDLS-C and the University of Toronto are investigating how to effectively use multi-agent reinforcement learning in field robotics. GDLS-C's goal is to improve situational awareness of ground vehicles by using heterogeneous teams of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Learning decentralized cooperation strategies will improve the resilience of these multi-robot systems—potentially faced with adversarial environments—and, ultimately, the safety of their human operators. Answering our research questions will also enable large collections of robots to learn how to interact with one another—beyond the point human designers can attain.

- Mitacs Globalink research at the University of Cambridge's [Prorok Laboratory][pl] on **adversarial private flocking**. Privacy is an important facet of defence against adversaries. In this project, we introduced the problem of private flocking. We considered a team of mobile robots flocking in the presence of an adversary who is interested in identifying their leader. We developed a method to generate private flocking controllers that hide the identity of the leader robot. Our concurrent approach towards privacy improvement leverages machine learning and game theory. To evaluate the performance of our co-optimization scheme, we investigated different classes of reference trajectories for the robots. Although it is reasonable to assume that there is an inherent trade-off between flocking performance and privacy, our results demonstrate that we are able to achieve high flocking performance and simultaneously reduce the risk of revealing the leader.

- ESA's Networking/Partnering Initiative postdoctoral research: **A Symbiotic Human and Multi-Robot Planetary Exploration System**. The availability of next generation heavy launchers—such as NASA’s SLS and SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy—will enable new planetary exploration missions. Most space agencies are now targeting the Moon as the next step in exploration beyond LEO and many already have plans for precursor [robotic and human exploration][esa]. For example, ESA has championed the “Moon Village” concept since 2016 and NASA’s 2018 budget includes a Lunar Exploration Campaign. In this context, natural caves are appealing solutions to shelter humans and equipment for long-duration Lunar missions. In 2017, data from JAXA’s Kaguya probe revealed a 50km-long lava tube. For safety reasons, the preliminary robotic exploration of these tubes is imperative. Multi-robot systems carry the potential for greater efficiency and higher fault-tolerance, because of their ability to cooperate and inherent redundancy. Including humans into these systems is desirable to mitigate the complexity of the system but challenging at the interface level.

- Jacopo's doctoral research focused on **adaptive computing system for aerospace**. Today’s computer systems are growing more and more complex at an unmanageable pace, and space, in particular, represents a challenging environment for them. Self-adaptive computing carries unmatched potential and great promises for the creation of a new generation of smart, more reliable computers. Drawing from the fields of artificial intelligence, autonomic computing, and reconfigurable systems, we aim at developing self-adaptive computer systems for aerospace. Our goal is to improve efficiency, fault-tolerance, and computational capabilities of aerospace computer systems, allowing them to perform their tasks for longer periods of time, fostering simpler and cheaper space exploration.

- From 2012 to 2017, Jacopo acted as the Command&Data-Handling team leader of the student society *Société Technique PolyOrbite* developing a 3U nanosatellite for the [Canadian Satellite Design Challenge][9] (CSDC), a Canada-wide competition for teams of university students. *PolyOrbite* obtained the 3rd overall place in the 2012-14 and 2014-16 editions of the CSDC, as well as the CSDC's Educational Outreach prize in 2016 [Website][6], [Facebook][7].
